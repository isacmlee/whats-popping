# What's Popping?
A web app that recommends songs based on the audio characteristics and your Spotify "Liked Songs" library. 
## Introduction
One of the great things about Spotify is their amazing ability to recommend new songs based on each user's own music personality. In a prior project, I attempted to create a song recommender that focuses on the songs themselves: [song-recommender](https://github.com/isacmlee/song-recommender). For example, Spotify gives each of their songs features (examples: tempo, instrumentalness, valence, popularity, etc). Each feature described the song numerically, enabling me to create a model that would predict which songs I would like based on the features of the songs I have liked. Once having completed that project, this web app enables me to share my recommender for others to use as well.
